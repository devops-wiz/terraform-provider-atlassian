# jira_work_types (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve a list of work types from Jira.

## Example Usage

There are 3 ways to use jira_work_types data source:
*   With no arguments (return all work types)
*   Using the `names` attribute to filter work types by name
*   Using the `ids` attribute to filter work types by id

### No Filtering

```terraform
data "jira_work_types" "example" {}
```

### Names Filtering

```terraform
data "jira_work_types" "example" {
  names = ["Bug", "Story"]
}
```

### Ids Filtering

```terraform
data "jira_work_types" "example" {
  ids = ["10000", "10004"]
}
```

### Nested Schema for `work_types`

Required:

- `name` (String) The display name of the work type. This appears in the issue creation dialog and issue views.

Optional:

- `description` (String) A detailed description of the work type. This helps users understand the purpose and usage of this work type.
- `hierarchy_level` (Number) The level of the work type in the hierarchy. There are a few rules:
	* A value of -1 indicates the work type is a subtask.
	* A value of 0 indicates the work type is a standard level work type.
	* Epics have a hierarchy level of 1, and in Jira Premium, hierarchy can be expand beyond the epic level. In this case values above 0 and below -1 can be used.

Read-Only:

- `avatar_id` (Number) The ID of the avatar for the work type.
- `icon_url` (String) The URL of the work type's icon.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the work type. Automatically generated by Jira when the work type is created.
- `subtask` (Boolean) Indicates whether this work type is used for subtasks. When `true`, issues of this type can only be created as children of other issues.
